## About The App
I would like to describe my eCommerce website as a well-designed and functional platform that allows users to easily browse and purchase products. I implemented the structural and presentational aspects of the website using HTML, CSS, Sass, and VS Code, and used BEM class naming to ensure a consistent and organized codebase. The website is fully responsive and adaptive, making it accessible on a variety of devices.
The functional part of the website was implemented using JavaScript, and features such as the ability to search for products, add them to a cart, modify or delete items, and place an order were all smoothly integrated. The use of local storage to manage product information added an extra level of functionality and convenience. Additionally, the use of ES6 demonstrated a strong understanding of modern coding practices and techniques.
## Technologies
I used Figma and public design to make this website.
Layout of page was made on HTML and styles were written with help of Sass on Css
The functional page was made on Vanila Js without any frameworks



## Status
[Ecommerce website] is not finished yet. My plan is to add a couple of pages with different type of clothes.
