This Application is made for educational purpuses. Ecommerce website is a prototype of usual shopping website where you have ability to buy clothes online.
You have abilty to see different products, put them into a cart with a different size. Alse you can modify items in cart and see a price of a product and a total price of your cart

## Technologies
I used Figma and public design to make this website.
Layout of page was made on HTML and styles were written with help of Sass on Css
The functional page was made on Vanila Js without any frameworks



## Status
[Ecommerce website] is not finished yet. My plan is to add a couple of pages with different type of clothes.
